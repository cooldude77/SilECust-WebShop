# Testing

The app has all the tests located in `test` folder including the fixtures.  

You may reuse the test after you modify the app. The packaged tests will only test for standard functionalities. You will need to write your own tests to confirm your own scenarios.  

It is recommended that you test your app thoroughly both at local machine and at a staging level before pushing the app to production
