# Quick Start

Yes, we are all bored with reading documentation.

So once you finish installation of Silecust on your machine , you can quickly start with using the url.

Login using your super admin id as created by you in [installation](../installation/installation.md) step
and create stuff in this order, in the `/admin` panel

## Create basic data
- Create location data ('country','state','city','pin codes' etc' )
- Create a few categories
- Create a few products using these categories
- Add images to the products
- Create new employees

## Ready for first impression?
- Checkout `/` page . You should be able to see your products with images listed on the site
- Search from the top bar for specific products and get a feel for the system
- Products cannot be added to the cart ( by the customer) as there is no price entry

## Create prices, discount, taxes
- Create prices , discount and taxes for your product
- Now customers can add products to the cart

## Use website as customer
Now either logout or use another browser as customer  
If you have already created a sample customer   
use `/login` to login into the portal 

**or**  
use `/signup` to sign up for new user.

If you have not added the prices ( as admin ) , you will not be able to add the product to the cart

Final checkout can be only done when taxes are added
