- Add prices, discount and taxation quickly
- Cart and checkout process pre-built. Just need to integrate your preferred payment gateway.
- Helpful event management system to integrate more functionality
- Install on a server or VM on personal computer

**Disclaimer:** For now Silecust is fit for development and testing , not for production.

## Product Philosophy

### Background

The Silecust project runs as vendor package to symfony application. Follow the installation guide to create the application. The benefits of Symfony product are simply incorporated in Silecust Web Shop Application

### Purpose

The web shop should be easy to set up. It should be extensible and configurable.

Most of the processes ( except external like payment integration) are readily made available and work together. You will
just need to add data and go online quickly.

### Roadmap

The processes will be made extendable with time and events added so that a developer can enhance the functionality on
their own.
