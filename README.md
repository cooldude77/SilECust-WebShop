# Silecust- Simple Webshop

## Marketing talk

**Silecust** is a simple elegant webshop that you can setup in your own server or machine very quickly. Silecust consists of

- Web shop where products can be added easily
- Based on world-class Symfony 7 framework
- Add prices, discount and taxation quickly
- Cart and checkout process pre-built. Just need to integrate your preferred payment gateway.
- Helpful event management system to integrate more functionality
- Install on a server or VM on personal computer
- Continuous feature additions
 
**Disclaimer:** For now Silecust is fit for development and testing , not for production.

## Product Philosophy

### Background
I have worked extensively on WordPress software. I liked the way one can customize and add information in addition to default functionality.  

### Purpose
 The web shop should be easy to set up. It should be extensible and configurable.   
 
Most of the processes ( except external like payment integration) are readily made available and work together. You will just need to add data and go online quickly.  

### Roadmap
The processes will be made extendable with time and events added so that a developer can enhance the functionality on their own.

### Current Status
The project is in development phase and alpha should be planned soon.
